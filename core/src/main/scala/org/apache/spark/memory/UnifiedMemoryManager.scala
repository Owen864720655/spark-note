/**
 * A [[MemoryManager]] that enforces a soft boundary between execution and storage such that
 * either side can borrow memory from the other.
 *
 * The region shared between execution and storage is a fraction of (the total heap space - 300MB)
 * configurable through `spark.memory.fraction` (default 0.6). The position of the boundary
 * within this space is further determined by `spark.memory.storageFraction` (default 0.5).
 * This means the size of the storage region is 0.6 * 0.5 = 0.3 of the heap space by default.
 *
 * Storage can borrow as much execution memory as is free until execution reclaims its space.
 * When this happens, cached blocks will be evicted from memory until sufficient borrowed
 * memory is released to satisfy the execution memory request.
 *
 * Similarly, execution can borrow as much storage memory as is free. However, execution
 * memory is *never* evicted by storage due to the complexities involved in implementing this.
 * The implication is that attempts to cache blocks may fail if execution has already eaten
 * up most of the storage space, in which case the new blocks will be evicted immediately
 * according to their respective storage levels.
 *
  * 新的内存管理模型，其中execution和storage两个的内存可以互相借用
  *
  * execution和storage共享的内存大小设置为（JVM总内存-300MB）* `spark.memory.fraction` (default 0.6)，
  * 其中storage默认的大小为`spark.memory.storageFraction` (default 0.5).也就是说，storage大小默认是
  * JVM堆空间的0.3
  *
  * storage可以无限制的借用execution未使用的内存空间，直到execution需要的内存不够时。当execution内存不够需要
  * 回收storage之前借用的内存时，storage被缓存的块会被从内存移到磁盘上，释放之前借用的execution的内存
  *
  * 同样的，execution也可以无限制的借用storage未使用的内存空间。但是由于本方法的复杂实现，execution已借用的内存不会
  * 被storage收回。意思就是如果execution已经占用了storage的大部分内存空间，当execution尝试缓存块时会失败，
  * 新块会被根据配置的存储级别被直接移除。
  *
 * @param onHeapStorageRegionSize Size of the storage region, in bytes.
 *                          This region is not statically reserved; execution can borrow from
 *                          it if necessary. Cached blocks can be evicted only if actual
 *                          storage memory usage exceeds this region.
