/**
 * A running job in the DAGScheduler. Jobs can be of two types: a result job, which computes a
 * ResultStage to execute an action, or a map-stage job, which computes the map outputs for a
 * ShuffleMapStage before any downstream stages are submitted. The latter is used for adaptive
 * query planning, to look at map output statistics before submitting later stages. We distinguish
 * between these two types of jobs using the finalStage field of this class.
 *
 * Jobs are only tracked for "leaf" stages that clients directly submitted, through DAGScheduler's
 * submitJob or submitMapStage methods. However, either type of job may cause the execution of
 * other earlier stages (for RDDs in the DAG it depends on), and multiple jobs may share some of
 * these previous stages. These dependencies are managed inside DAGScheduler.
  *
  * ActiveJob代表在DAGScheduler中运行的job。一共有两类job：result job，用来执行一个action并计算ResultStage；
  * map-stage job，用来在下游stage提交前为ShuffleMapStage计算map输出。第二类job被用在查询计划中，在提交下游
  * stage前会查看map输出统计。我们使用finalStage成员变量来区分这两类job。
  *
  * job只跟踪client通过DAGScheduler submitJob/submitMapStage方法直接提交的叶子节点的stage。但是任意一种job都
  * 可能导致之前的stage执行（在DAG中rdd所依赖的stage），并且多个job可以共享相同的父stage。这些依赖关系由
  * DAGScheduler所管理。
 *
 * @param jobId A unique ID for this job.
 * @param finalStage The stage that this job computes (either a ResultStage for an action or a
 *   ShuffleMapStage for submitMapStage).
 * @param callSite Where this job was initiated in the user's program (shown on UI).
 * @param listener A listener to notify if tasks in this job finish or the job fails.
 * @param properties Scheduling properties attached to the job, such as fair scheduler pool name.
